# Lazada-Spin-the-Wheel-Miner

Tool to automate HTTP requests to Lazada's Spin the Wheel game to obtain vouchers - Used since 2015 to 2017 which then Lazada took down the game (RIP Spin the Wheel). Vouchers collected are saved into a text file.

Runs using a .bat script which automatically restarts the tool once a voucher is found, or if the tool throws an unhandled exception. This is in particular useful if the tool is ran from places where internet connection is bad. Multiple instances of the tool can be executed.
